Nominal takes also act as maximums: the actual takes are never higher than the nominal ones, even if additional income is available."
msgstr ""

msgid "You may wonder why we treat nominal takes as maximums instead of simple percentages. It's because having maximums allows a team to have unused income (called “leftover”), and that is good in several ways. Firstly, it provides a “cushion” that stabilizes the income of the team's members. Secondly, it eases the integration of new members into a team, because as they increase their takes they reduce the leftover instead of affecting the income of the other members. Thirdly, it allows our software to adjust the amounts that donors actually transfer to the team's members, in a way that balances the donors' contributions over time, thus making the system more fair. Finally, it encourages donating to a team even if it has already reached its funding goal, which is good for the staibility of the team's income."

msgid "Regulation of take amounts"
msgstr ""

msgid "When this feature is enabled for a team, its members can't raise their takes higher than a maximum computed on the basis of the nominal takes at the time of the previous payday.

msgstr ""

msgid "The limit works like this: you can always increase your take to 1.00 if it was below that, you can double your take compared to the previous week, you can raise your take to claim the team's leftover income, and you can bring your take up to the level of the median take in the previous payday. Whichever of these possibilities results in the highest amount is your maximum take for the week."
