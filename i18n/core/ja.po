"\n"
"If you use Liberapay as a donor the first choice is recommended, especially if you wish to continue using Liberapay. This first option distributes all the money from your wallet to the people who would have normally received it over time. The recipients will be able to see that this sudden burst of income corresponds to multiple weeks of donations.\n"
"\n"
"For example, if you’re donating $1 per week to 2 creators, and you have $40 in your wallet, then each creator will receive $20, and 20 weeks from now you’ll receive our usual email reminding you that it’s time to add money again.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that the disbursement may fail for various reasons. If you get an error message like “The attempt to distribute all the money in your wallet failed: XX.XX remains.” then the problem is probably on the recipient side, for example someone who hasn’t filled the identity form or a team that hasn’t defined how the income should be split between the members.\n"
"\n"
"The other option is to get your money back, if possible through a refund, otherwise by withdrawing it to your bank account.\n"
"\n"
"If you receive donations on Liberapay you may want to wait a week before withdrawing your income in order to give your patrons a chance to transfer the remaining of their donations from their wallets to yours.\n"
"\n"
"We’ll inform you as soon as the integration of a new payment processor is complete, and tell you if there’s anything you need to do to start receiving donations on Liberapay again.\n"

msgstr ""

msgid "The nominal takes are the raw numbers that the members input themselves, the actual takes are computed by the system: first it sums up the nominal takes, then it computes the percentage that each take represents, and finally it applies those percentages to the available income. Nominal takes also act as maximums: the actual takes are never higher than the nominal ones, even if additional income is available."
msgstr ""

msgid "You may wonder why we treat nominal takes as maximums instead of simple percentages. It's because having maximums allows a team to have unused income (called “leftover”), and that is good in several ways. Firstly, it provides a “cushion” that stabilizes the income of the team's members. Secondly, it eases the integration of new members into a team, because as they increase their takes they reduce the leftover instead of affecting the income of the other members. Thirdly, it allows our software to adjust the amounts that donors actually transfer to the team's members, in a way that balances the donors' contributions over time, thus making the system more fair. Finally, it encourages donating to a team even if it has already reached its funding goal, which is good for the stability of the team's income."

msgid "Regulation of take amounts"
msgstr ""

msgid "When this feature is enabled for a team, its members can't raise their takes higher than a maximum computed on the basis of the nominal takes at the time of the previous payday. This mechanism is meant to encourage inviting new contributors to join the team, by ensuring that they won't take a disproportionate share of the income in their first weeks."
msgstr ""

msgid "The limit works like this: you can always increase your take to 1.00 if it was below that, you can double your take compared to the previous week, you can raise your take to claim the team's leftover income, and you can bring your take up to the level of the median take in the previous payday. Whichever of these possibilities results in the highest amount is your maximum take for the week."
