msgid "The nominal takes are the raw numbers that the members input themselves, the actual takes are computed by the system: first it sums up the nominal takes, then it computes the percentage that each take represents, and finally it applies those percentages to the available income. Nominal takes also act as maximums: the actual takes are never higher than the nominal ones, even if additional income is available."
msgstr "名目上的收取是成员所输入的粗略数字，而真实收取则是由系统计算：首先它会加总名目收取，然后再计算每份收取代表的百分比，最后再将此百分比依可得收入转算。名目收取通常代表最大：而实际收取不会高过名目，即便有多出来的收入。"

msgid "You may wonder why we treat nominal takes as maximums instead of simple percentages. It's because having maximums allows a team to have unused income (called “leftover”), and that is good in several ways. Firstly, it provides a “cushion” that stabilizes the income of the team's members. Secondly, it eases the integration of new members into a team, because as they increase their takes they reduce the leftover instead of affecting the income of the other members. Thirdly, it allows our software to adjust the amounts that donors actually transfer to the team's members, in a way that balances the donors' contributions over time, thus making the system more fair. Finally, it encourages donating to a team even if it has already reached its funding goal, which is good for the stability of the team's income."
msgstr "你可能会问为什么我们认为那些名目上的收取是最大值而非简单的百分比。这是因为最大值使团队能够拥有闲钱，且此方式在几个方面有很大好处。首先，它能为均衡团队成员的收入提供缓冲。其次，它能使新成员更加简单地加入一个团队，因为在他们提高自己的分成时只会减少闲钱而非影响其他成员的收入。再说，它能使我们的软件调整数目来让捐助者事实上以一种平衡贡献的方式转帐给团队成员，从而使这个系统更加公平。最后，即使一个团队已经达到其目标，它仍旧鼓励人们向其捐款，从而使团队收入更加稳定。"
