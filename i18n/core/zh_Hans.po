msgid "The nominal takes are the raw numbers that the members input themselves, the actual takes are computed by the system: first it sums up the nominal takes, then it computes the percentage that each take represents, and finally it applies those percentages to the available income. Nominal takes also act as maximums: the actual takes are never higher than the nominal ones, even if additional income is available."
msgstr "名目收取是成员自己所输入的数额，而实际收取是由系统计算得出：首先计算出名目收取的总和，然后得出每份收取代表的百分比，最后将此百分比套入可得收入。名目收取也是“最高得到”：实际收取不会高过名目收取，即便有多出来的收入。"

msgid "You may wonder why we treat nominal takes as maximums instead of simple percentages. It's because having maximums allows a team to have unused income (called “leftover”), and that is good in several ways. Firstly, it provides a “cushion” that stabilizes the income of the team's members. Secondly, it eases the integration of new members into a team, because as they increase their takes they reduce the leftover instead of affecting the income of the other members. Thirdly, it allows our software to adjust the amounts that donors actually transfer to the team's members, in a way that balances the donors' contributions over time, thus making the system more fair. Finally, it encourages donating to a team even if it has already reached its funding goal, which is good for the stability of the team's income."
msgstr "您可能想知道，为什么我们将名目上的收取视作最大值而非简单的百分比。这是因为最大值使团队能有未使用的收入（称作“盈余”），此方式在多方面有很大好处。首先，它能为稳定团队成员的收入提供缓冲。其次，它能降低新成员融入一个团队的难度，因为增加新成员的收入只会减少盈余，而非影响其他成员的收入。再者，它允许我们的软件调整捐助者实际转给团队成员的金额，随时间推移平衡捐助者的贡献，使系统更加公平。最后，即使一个团队已经达到其目标，它仍能鼓励人们向其捐款，使团队收入更加稳定。"

msgid "Automatic takes"
msgstr "自动分配"

msgid "By default all team members have their take set to the special value 'auto', which corresponds to an equal share of the leftover. In other words, the members who set their takes explicitly get funded first, then whatever's left is distributed in equal amounts to the members who have automatic takes."
msgstr "所有团队成员的默认分成设置为特殊值“自动”（auto），对应剩余份额均分。换而言之，明确设置分成的成员被优先资助，余下资金被均分给设为“自动”级别的成员。"

msgid "Regulation of take amounts"
msgstr "收取份额的规定"

msgid "When “take throttling” is enabled for a team, its members can't raise their takes higher than a maximum computed on the basis of the nominal takes at the time of the previous payday. This mechanism is meant to encourage inviting new contributors to join the team, by ensuring that they won't take a disproportionate share of the income in their first weeks."
msgstr "当一个团队启用“分成节流”功能时，团队成员无法将自己的收取改为高于前一个捐款日中名目收取的最大值。该功能是为了邀请更多的新志愿者加入团队，且保障成员不会在前几周拿到比例失衡的收入。"

#, python-brace-format
msgid "The limit works like this: you can always increase your take to {amount} if it was below that, you can double your take compared to the previous week, you can raise your take to claim the team's leftover income, and you can bring your take up to the level of the median take in the previous payday. Whichever of these possibilities results in the highest amount is your maximum take for the week."
msgstr "限制原理如下：您随时可以将自己的分成提升至最高 {amount}，您可以使自己较前一周的分成翻倍，您可以提升自己的分成来领取团队的盈余，您还可以将分成提升到上一个捐款日的中位数。以上算法中的最高收入，作为您本周的分成上限。"

msgid "Takes are not limited if the team has only one member, or if the previous week's takes were all zero (which is the case for any new team that has been created after the most recent payday)."
msgstr "若团队只有一名成员，或是前一周的分成均为零（在最近一次捐款日之后创建的团队），分成没有限制。"
