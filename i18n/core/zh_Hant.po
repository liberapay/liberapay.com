msgid "The nominal takes are the raw numbers that the members input themselves, the actual takes are computed by the system: first it sums up the nominal takes, then it computes the percentage that each take represents, and finally it applies those percentages to the available income. Nominal takes also act as maximums: the actual takes are never higher than the nominal ones, even if additional income is available."
msgstr "名目上的收取是成員所輸入的粗略數字，而真實收取則是由系統計算：首先它會加總名目收取，然後再計算每份收取代表的百分比，最後再將此百分比依可得收入轉算。名目收取通常代表最大：而實際收取不會高過名目，即便有多出來的收入。"

msgid "You may wonder why we treat nominal takes as maximums instead of simple percentages. It's because having maximums allows a team to have unused income (called “leftover”), and that is good in several ways. Firstly, it provides a “cushion” that stabilizes the income of the team's members. Secondly, it eases the integration of new members into a team, because as they increase their takes they reduce the leftover instead of affecting the income of the other members. Thirdly, it allows our software to adjust the amounts that donors actually transfer to the team's members, in a way that balances the donors' contributions over time, thus making the system more fair. Finally, it encourages donating to a team even if it has already reached its funding goal, which is good for the stability of the team's income."
msgstr "你可能會問為什麼我們認為那些名目上的收取是最大值而非簡單的百分比。這是因為最大值使團隊能夠擁有閒錢，且此方式在幾個方面有很大好處。首先，它能為均衡團隊成員的收入提供緩衝。其次，它能使新成員更加簡單地加入一個團隊，因為在他們提高自己的分成時只會減少閒錢而非影響其他成員的收入。再說，它能使我們的軟件調整數目來讓捐助者事實上以一種平衡貢獻的方式轉帳給團隊成員，從而使這個系統更加公平。最後，即使一個團隊已經達到其目標，它仍舊鼓勵人們向其捐款，從而使團隊收入更加穩定。"
