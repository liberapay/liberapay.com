<p>{{ _(
    "The nominal takes are the raw numbers that the members input themselves, "

    "finally it applies those percentages to the available income. Nominal "
    "takes also act as maximums: the actual takes are never higher than the "
    "nominal ones, even if additional income is available."
) }}</p>

<p>{{ _(
    "You may wonder why we treat nominal takes as maximums instead of simple "
    "percentages. It's because having maximums allows a team to have unused "
    "income (called “leftover”), and that is good in several ways. Firstly, it "
    "provides a “cushion” that stabilizes the income of the team's members. "
    "Secondly, it eases the integration of new members into a team, because as "
    "they increase their takes they reduce the leftover instead of affecting "
    "the income of the other members. Thirdly, it allows our software to adjust "
    "the amounts that donors actually transfer to the team's members, in a way "
    "that balances the donors' contributions over time, thus making the system "
    "more fair. Finally, it encourages donating to a team even if it has "
    "already reached its funding goal, which is good for the stability of the "
    "team's income."

    "inviting new contributors to join the team, by ensuring that they won't "
    "take a disproportionate share of the income in their first weeks."
) }}</p>

<p>{{ _(
    "The limit works like this: You can always increase your take to 1.00 if it "
    "was below that, you can double your take compared to the previous week, "
    "you can raise your take to claim the team's leftover income, and you can "
    "bring your take up to the level of the median take in the previous payday. "
    "Whichever of these possibilities results in the highest amount is your "
    "maximum take for the week."
